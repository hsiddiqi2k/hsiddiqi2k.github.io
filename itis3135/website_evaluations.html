		<h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
        
		<section>
			<h3><a href="https://www.skype.com/en/">Good Site</a></h3>

			<p>This is the main page for Skype. it shows off the common features and has an easily accessible download link.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Contrast: The elements have proper contrast. Anything with text on it has a light background, and the text itself is dark</li>
				<li>Repetition: There is proper repetition throughout the site. All text, font, sizes of fonts are uniform through.</li>
				<li>Alignment: All the elements on the site are properly alligned. Near the middle there is a place where you can scroll through the features and everything is aligned well.</li>
				<li>Proximity: Like stated above there is a place to scroll through features. All these features make sense to be next to each other.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>



        <section>
			<h3><a href="https://arngren.net/">Bad Site</a></h3>

			<p>This is a Norwegian site that seems to be selling a multiude or products including ATV's, bikes, and scooters. Please have an adblocker enabled before visiting this site.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Contrast: The elements on this site have werid contrast. The background is white but all the text are different colors. There is text on pictures but with bad contrast. All these things make it hard to read.</li>
				<li>Repetition: There is zero uniformity in this site. As stated before, the color of the text are all different colors. Some text is bold for no apparent reason. Size of text is not uniform.</li>
				<li>Alignment: There is no alignment with the pictures. They are all placed randomly throughout the website. Makes it hard for the reader to know where to look.</li>
				<li>Proximity: The elements on the website do not follow this rule. The pictures that are placed together within boarders do not make sense together. For example, there is a Ferrari next to a scooter and a bike.</li>
			</ul>
